"vectors are just numbers with two (or more) components" so i think that these I/Q data are vectors - it would be cool
if i could use this and create a visualization like some of the vector tuts for p5js
"The terms I and Q actually have a meaning â€” I means "Inphase" and Q means "Quadrature" (more detail). I mention this because the use of I for the real component, and Q
 for the imaginary component, of a complex number seems perversely confusing"

* one answer here said that sdrs output quadrature waveform data - which means that each sample contains both magnitude
  and phase info 
* so in the case of RTL a sample contains an 8-bit (real) component and an 8-bit Q (imaginary) component, which represent
  one point in time

okay, this is definitely what my samples from Greenbank are, so that's exciting!!
but like wtf do i do with that?
